Kearny
======

A lightweight Sinatra / D3 application suited for wall-mounted stats
visualizations. Developed for use at [Causes](http://www.causes.com), where we
love graphs and numbers.

### About

Metrics-driven development is great, but having to manually check disparate data
sources to get a feeling for the various ways we're constantly trying to
improve.

Kearny provides a way to hook up various backends such as
[Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com),
[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics),
and [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com).
